#Introduction
There are four images travic1.jpg, travic2.jpg, route1.jpg and route2.jpg

**travic1.jpg and travic2.jpg:** 
display the simulated public-transit system in Europe from the feed which was generated by my program.

In travic1 each red or grey point means a long-distance train or local train/tram.

**route1.jpg and route2.jpg:** 
are the results that I use OpenTripPlaner with my feed to search for train-combinations for a trip. Particularly in route2 the trip contains exchanges.
