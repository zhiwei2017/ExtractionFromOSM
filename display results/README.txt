images: travic1 and travic2 display the simulated public-transit system in Europe from the feed which was generated by my program.

In travic1 each red or grey point means a long-distance train or local train/tram.

images: route1 and route2 are the results that I use OpenTripPlaner with my feed to search for train-combinations for a trip. Particularly in route2 the trip contains exchanges.
